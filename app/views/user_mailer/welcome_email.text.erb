Dear <%= @athlete_name %>,

Thanks for connecting your Strava account with <%= @app_name%>!

All <%= @app_name%> charts related "Races" are analyzed from those activities tagged as "Race" in Strava.

Your <%= @app_name%> profile URL is <%= @athlete_profile_url %>.
Feel free to bookmark it so that you won't lose your way back!
